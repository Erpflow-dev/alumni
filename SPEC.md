# SPEC.md — alumni canonical reference

The authoritative spec. Code and SPEC must agree; fix the wrong one.

> **Frappe v16 only.** Use type annotations on every controller method. UUID autoname for opaque IDs (audit, polymorphic, votes). Format-string autoname for human-readable IDs.

> **Spec version:** v3 — adds private messaging, document-based verification, full election system, donation categories + comments + guest donations, taxonomy for News/Notices, social login, 2FA, multilingual/RTL, and a documented multi-tenancy story. These were added after a feature-parity review against ZaiAlumni and several incumbent alumni products.

## §00 Module overview

`alumni` is a standalone Frappe v16 app. Two install modes selected at first-run wizard, switchable in `Alumni Settings`.

**Modes:**
- `school_connected` — auto-promote from `frappe/education`, payments through ERPNext, analytics linkable to Insights.
- `standalone` — self-registration + manual + CSV import; lightweight built-in receivables; in-app Chart.js analytics.

**Multi-tenancy:** one Frappe site = one institution (per ADR-010). To run a SaaS — many institutions on one bench — use Frappe's native multi-site (per ADR-035). A v2 companion app `alumni_saas` adds super-admin / billing on top; not in v1.

**Required external apps (both modes):** `frappe v16+`, `payments`, `buzz`.

**Reads:** `tabStudent` (school_connected), `tabBuzz Event` (always, via adapter).
**Writes:** ERPNext `Customer`/`Sales Invoice`/`Payment Entry` (school_connected) OR `Alumni Invoice`/`Alumni Payment` (standalone). Always: `Buzz Event` and related (via events adapter).

## §01 Roles

| Role | Inherits | Can |
|---|---|---|
| Guest | — | Public site only; donate to public campaigns; view public Q&A; view candidate profiles in active elections |
| Alumni | Guest | Edit own profile, post pending content, buy memberships/tickets, donate, message peers, RSVP, request mentorship as mentee, ask network, sign up for volunteering, join chapter, vote in elections, comment on candidates and campaigns |
| Alumni Mentor | Alumni | Accept mentorship requests, log sessions |
| Alumni Moderator | Alumni | Approve/reject pending content (Stories, Job Posts, News, Notices, Network Questions) |
| Alumni Board Member | Alumni | Oversee elections — review nominations, approve final candidate list, audit votes, publish results |
| Alumni Admin | Moderator | Full management of all DocTypes including Settings, Newsletters, Memberships, Themes, Elections, CMS pages, Donation Campaigns |
| System Manager | Admin | Frappe-level (break-glass) |

> **Note:** Frappe v16 supports per-site Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP / Google Authenticator). Per ADR-036, 2FA is **mandatory** for Admin / Board Member / System Manager roles and **optional** (admin-toggleable as a soft requirement) for Alumni.

## §02 Lifecycle

### School-Connected mode
1. **Auto-promote** nightly job: Students with completed final term + zero outstanding fees → Alumni Profile (Draft) → invitation email next morning.
2. **Manual conversion**: admin button on Student record.
3. **Self-registration**: public form for pre-deployment graduates (with verification documents per ADR-032).

### Standalone mode
1. **Self-registration**: public form, requires email verification + one or more verification documents → admin approval workflow.
2. **Manual create**: admin enters individual records (with optional welcome email + temp password).
3. **CSV import**: admin bulk-imports old yearbook data.
4. **Past Student stub**: admin enters historical alumni in `Past Student` DocType, then converts in batches.

### Alumni Profile state machine
`Draft → Pending Email → Pending Docs → Active → Suspended | Deceased`

> Substates are named for what's *still pending*, matching the `Alumni Profile.status` Select values exactly. `Pending Email` = waiting for email verification; `Pending Docs` = email verified, waiting for verification document review.

The two Pending substates exist so admins can see whether a self-registered profile has cleared each gate. School-Connected auto-promoted profiles skip Pending entirely → land at Active (Draft only if `auto_promote_requires_review` is set).

---

### Alumni Comment — polymorphic, UUID autoname (schema for §03 #23)
- `name` autoname `uuid`
- `parent_doctype` Data req — one of: `Alumni Story`, `Alumni News Article`, `Alumni Notice`, `Alumni Post`, `Alumni Donation Campaign`, `Alumni Candidate` (allow-list enforced in `validate`)
- `parent_name` Data req
- `commenter` Link → Alumni Profile req
- `body` Long Text req (≤2000 chars; rich text sanitized via `bleach` allow-list — same profile as vCard FAQ)
- `parent_comment` Link → Alumni Comment (1-level threading; null = top-level)
- `is_published` Check default 1 (Moderator can flip to 0 to hide)
- `is_flagged` Check default 0
- `flag_reason` Small Text (set by reporter; never displayed to commenter)
- `flagged_by` Link → User

- `edited_on` Datetime
- DB-level index on `(parent_doctype, parent_name)` for feed lookups
- DB-level index on `(commenter, commented_on)` for "my comments" view

> Polymorphic by design — one DocType serves all comment surfaces. The `parent_doctype` allow-list lives in the controller, not in a Select field, so adding a new commentable DocType is a one-line code change. Distinct from `Alumni Campaign Comment` (donation-campaign-specific, supports guest comments) and `Alumni Candidate Comment` (election-specific, has its own moderation workflow). When the v3 spec was written those two were modeled separately because they predate this generic table; the generic `Alumni Comment` is for everything else (Story, News, Notice, Post). Migration of the two specialized comment DocTypes to this generic table is a v2 cleanup, not v1.

### Alumni Reaction — polymorphic, UUID autoname (schema for §03 #24)
- `name` autoname `uuid`
- `parent_doctype` Data req — same allow-list as `Alumni Comment.parent_doctype` plus `Alumni Comment` itself (reactions on comments allowed)
- `parent_name` Data req
- `reactor` Link → Alumni Profile req
- `kind` Select req: `Like` / `Celebrate` / `Insightful` / `Support` / `Curious`
- `reacted_on` Datetime auto
- DB-level **unique** index on `(parent_doctype, parent_name, reactor, kind)` to prevent duplicate same-kind reactions (a user *can* leave a Like AND a Celebrate, but not two Likes)
- DB-level index on `(parent_doctype, parent_name)` for aggregate counts on render

> Toggle semantics: re-submitting the same `(parent, reactor, kind)` deletes the existing row (un-react), per the API contract in `react()` in `alumni/api.py`.

---

## §11 Receivables flow (mode-agnostic)

```
[User clicks Buy / Donate / Nominate]           [User clicks Book Event]
        ↓                                                 ↓

Three parallel paths now (events through Buzz, memberships/donations/**nominations** through our receivables adapter).

## §12 In-app dashboards (no Insights dependency)

10 Vue dashboards using Chart.js, data from `analytics_<mode>.py`:

1. **Network Overview** — total alumni, active vs dormant, by passing year, by country, monthly newcomers, profile completion %.
2. **Membership Funnel** — eligible → subscribed → active → renewed; renewal rate; churn reasons.
3. **Event Performance** — pulled from Buzz Event data: tickets sold, no-show %, revenue, repeat attendees.
4. **Donations** — total raised by campaign, donor cohorts, top-N donors, recurring vs one-time, **guest vs alumni split**.
5. **Job Board** — active jobs, apps per job, time-to-hire, posters vs hirers.
6. **Mentorship Impact** — active pairs, sessions per pair, mentee outcomes, reported issues.
7. **Newsletter Engagement** — open rate, click rate, unsubs, segment comparison.
8. **Messaging Health** — **NEW v3** — threads opened, response rate, % blocked, reports filed.
9. **Election Participation** — **NEW v3** — eligible voters, turnout %, turnout by passing year, turnout by chapter, nomination volume by position.
10. **Verification Pipeline** — **NEW v3** — pending email verifications, pending docs review, average time-to-verified, rejection reasons.

If Insights installed, each dashboard shows "Open in Insights →" link.
